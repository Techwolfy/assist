Assist-Scraper
==============

Web scraper for articulation agreements on [assist.org](http://assist.org). Allows for local searches of the database (e.g. to search for reverse articulation to anywhere to your current college).


Usage
-----

Find the code for your college from the main menu on [assist.org](http:/assist.org) and update the `university` variable at the top of the script, then run it.
The script will then attempt to download all current agreements for all majors for that university.
